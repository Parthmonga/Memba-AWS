# Search Engine Optimization

## Guidelines

SEO involves too many rules to be reported (and regularly updated) here. 
Google provides a [starter guide](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.co.uk/en/uk/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf) which can be used as development guidelines.

## Tools

Anyway, SEO rules are better reported by tools. The tools involved in the SEO Analysis of our web applications and sites are:

- [IIS SEO Toolkit](http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/search-engine-optimization-toolkit)
- http://seositecheckup.com/
- http://tools.seochat.com/
- Google Tools:
    - [Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/)
    - [Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics)
    - [Page Speed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/)

We recommend these tools be run periodically.

## Title, description and keywords

Title should be less that 64 characters long

Description should ideally be between 100 and 160 characters long

To make lists of keywords:

- [Google AdWords Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner#search.none)
- [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/)
